### 1. **User Entity**
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "Users")
@Data
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String password;

    private int projectSize;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "asignee", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JsonIgnore
    private List<Issue> assignedIssues = new ArrayList<>();

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "owner")
    @JsonIgnore
    private List<Project> ownedProjects = new ArrayList<>();
}
```

**Properties:**
- `id`: Primary key of the user (auto-generated).
- `name`: Name of the user.
- `email`: Email address of the user.
- `password`: The user's password.
- `projectSize`: A count or metric to track how many projects a user is associated with.

**Relationships:**
- `assignedIssues`: **One-to-Many** relationship with `Issue` where the user is the assignee of multiple issues. The `mappedBy` attribute indicates that the `Issue` class has a reference to `User` under the field `asignee`.
- `ownedProjects`: **One-to-Many** relationship with `Project` where the user owns multiple projects. The `mappedBy` refers to the `owner` property in the `Project` class.

**Real-World Example:**
- A user is a person who can own multiple projects and be assigned to multiple issues (tasks). For example, a software developer can be the owner of multiple software projects and be assigned tasks within those projects.

    private String category;

    @ElementCollection
    private List<String> tags = new ArrayList<>();

    @ManyToOne
    private Chat chat;

    @ManyToOne
    private User owner;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "project", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
    private List<Issue> issues = new ArrayList<>();
}
```

**Properties:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for the project.
- `description`: A brief description of the project.
- `category`: The category or type of the project (e.g., software development, marketing campaign).
- `tags`: A list of tags related to the project (e.g., "urgent", "backend", "feature").
- `chat`: A reference to the `Chat` entity, where project-related discussions happen.
- `owner`: A reference to the `User` entity, indicating the user who owns the project.
- `issues`: A list of `Issue` entities related to the project.

**Relationships:**
- `chat`: **Many-to-One** relationship with `Chat`. This means each project has one chat associated with it, and a single chat can belong to multiple projects.

- `issues`: **One-to-Many** relationship with `Issue`. A project can have multiple issues assigned to it. This is where the tasks or problems are tracked.

**Real-World Example:**
- A project can be a software development project. The `owner` is the person who created or leads the project, and the `issues` are the tasks or problems to be solved in the project. Each project also has a dedicated `chat` for communication among team members.

### 3. **Chat Entity**
```java
@Entity
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Data
public class Chat {

    private Project project;

    private String name;

    @ManyToMany
    private List<User> userList = new ArrayList<>();

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "chat", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
    @JsonIgnore

}
```

**Properties:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for the chat.
- `project`: A reference to the `Project` entity, indicating which project this chat is associated with.
- `name`: The name of the chat (e.g., "General Chat", "Feature Discussions").

- `messages`: A list of `Messages` related to the chat. These are the actual messages exchanged in the chat.

**Relationships:**
- `project`: **Many-to-One** relationship with `Project`. Each chat is linked to a specific project.
- `userList`: **Many-to-Many** relationship with `User`. Multiple users can be part of a chat, and a user can belong to multiple chats.
- `messages`: **One-to-Many** relationship with `Messages`. A chat can contain many messages, and each message belongs to one chat.

**Real-World Example:**
- A chat is where communication happens for a specific project. For example, a "Backend Issues" chat in a software project where team members discuss backend-related problems. It involves multiple users, and the messages exchanged are stored.

### 4. **Messages Entity**
```java
@Entity
@Data
public class Messages {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)

### 6. **Comment Entity**
```java
@Entity
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor

### Summary of Relationships:

- **User ↔ Issue**: One user can be assigned to multiple issues.
- **Project ↔ Issue**: A project can have many issues associated with it.
- **Project ↔ Chat**: Each project has a related chat.
- **User ↔ Chat**: A user can participate in multiple chats.
- **User ↔ Messages**: A user can send multiple messages in chats.
- **Issue ↔ Comment**: An issue can have many comments.

This overall structure helps manage projects, issues, users, and communications in a system, like a project management tool or a bug tracking system. Each entity plays a crucial role in representing the domain and its relationships with each other.
